# Akasha
An Ansible repo.

## What's with the Name?
In Hinduism, Akasha roughly translates to "aether" or "the basis of all things". In Western religious philosphy, the Akashic library is a collection of all knowledge and history. 

Seems fitting for an ansible repo.

## Setup
`./setup.sh`

## Environment
The set setup script sets up a pipenv virtual environment. `pipenv shell` will get you into that environment.
